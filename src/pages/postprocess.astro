    Developed and maintained since 2022, Naninovel Post Process is a popular extension for Naninovel that lets you easily add and manipulate post processing effects in real time and copy their corresponding command and parameters directly into the visual editor or clipboard.
    <br><br>
   It was used in the development of <a href="/wotl"><b><u>Whispers of the Luminaries</u></b></a> as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3275280/Storm_the_Swan__And_the_Power_of_FRIENDSHIP_and_IMAGINATION/"><b><u>Storm the Swan</u></b></a>, the latter of which received viral attention and was showcased on ManlyBadassHero's YouTube channel, among others.
