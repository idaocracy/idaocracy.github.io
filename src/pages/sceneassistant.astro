    Developed and maintained since 2021, Naninovel Scene Assistant is the most popular extension for Naninovel that lets you easily modify objects in real time and copy their corresponding command and parameters directly into the visual editor or clipboard.
    <br><br>
    I have maintained and updated the extension since August 2021, and it has served as a platform to showcase my growth as a programmer.
    <br><br>
   It has been received acclaim by many Naninovel developers, and has been especially helpful for granting non-programmers more granular control over their scenes. It was used in the development of <a href="/wotl"><b><u>Whispers of the Luminaries</u></b></a> as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3275280/Storm_the_Swan__And_the_Power_of_FRIENDSHIP_and_IMAGINATION/"><b><u>Storm the Swan</u></b></a>, the latter of which received viral attention and was showcased on ManlyBadassHero's YouTube channel, among others.
