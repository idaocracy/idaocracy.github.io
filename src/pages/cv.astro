    I am a highly adaptable professional driven by creativity, curiosity, and a passion for problem-solving. With expertise in both technology and creative fields, I thrive on tackling projects from the ground up and continually seek opportunities to hone my skills beyond my core responsibilities.
    <br><br>
    Recently, I released my first solo game project, designed to support anxious language learners in practicing conversational skills using AI. I am excited to continue exploring the potential of the technology, with a particular focus on developing tools and experiences that showcase innovative and emerging aspects of the technology.
    <br><br>
    Outside of my work, I am constantly on the prowl for new experiences. I am particularly interested broadening my world view through various forms of media or travel, having solo backpacked to over 40 countries to this date.
