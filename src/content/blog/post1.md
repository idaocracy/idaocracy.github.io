Why Naninovel? 
Naninovel is the most extensive publicly available visual novel engine on the market. 

Having worked with it for over 5 years, I can list the benefits of using it:
- Provides a set of templates and core visual novel features to kickstart your visual novel development
- Uses its own language for scenario scripting that is designed to be writer-friendly and has its own VS Code extension for syntax highlighting and refactoring
- Designed to be as extensible as possible; virtually any feature is customizable and the extension itself can be used as drop-in dialogue system for your non-visual novel game
- Doesn't limit you in terms of what you can achieve in Unity, any third-party plugin can be integrated into Naninovel or vice-versa
- Naninovel game can be published to multiple platforms such as Android, iOS, Switch, PS5, WebGL etc. with just a few extra steps 
- Clear and readable codebase
